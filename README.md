NOTES:
- Tested Application on iPhone SE
- I'm using attributed text strings, so I've included the fonts in the
	resources folder, you might need to import them to your font book. I've
	also added them to the actual project themselves, but apparently attributed
	text works differently, so just in case, if it doesn't work, there's a fix.
